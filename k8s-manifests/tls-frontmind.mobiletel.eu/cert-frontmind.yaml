# NOTE: Manual Certificate creation is not needed!
# The ingress with cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer annotation
# automatically creates and manages the certificate.
#
# If you need to manually create a certificate, use this configuration:
#
# apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
# kind: Certificate
# metadata:
#   name: frontmind-cert
#   namespace: ai-receptionist
# spec:
#   secretName: frontmind-tls
#   issuerRef:
#     kind: ClusterIssuer
#     name: letsencrypt-prod
#   dnsNames:
#     - frontmind.mobiletel.eu
#
# However, this can cause conflicts with ingress-managed certificates.
# The recommended approach is to let the ingress handle certificate creation.
